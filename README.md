# QuestPlayer
Fork quest player

This is basically a patch to BOOMik's Quest Player for Android, tested on Android 5.1.1.

TO DO:
1. Properly implement center and table html codes
2. Get GIFs to animate properly on Android OS 4.4.4

Stuff Fixed as of 1.3.1:
1. Inventory menu icon doesn't turn orange any more. Character description menu icon no longer animates on update (still turns orange).
2. Displayed images scaled to fit screen height as well as width.
3. Found and translated all Russian texts to English (I think).
