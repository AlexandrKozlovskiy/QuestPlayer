# QuestPlayer
Fork quest player

This is basically a patch to BOOMik's Quest Player for Android, tested on Android 5.1.1. Requires a minimum of Android 4.4 to function.

TO DO:
1. Get GIFs to animate properly on Android OS 4.4.4 (may be working - will verify)
2. Give player option to change max height of images relative to screen size
3. Multi-language support

Stuff Fixed as of 1.4:
1. Inventory menu icon doesn't turn orange any more. Character description menu icon no longer animates on update (still turns orange).
2. Displayed images scaled to fit screen height as well as width.
3. Found and translated all Russian texts to English (I think).
4. Changed TextView to WebView (Android 4.4+ only) -> Center/Tables codes implemented
5.Most images will zoom on a long-click
